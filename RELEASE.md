# Releasing cat_tools

cat_tools builds on pgxntool (https://github.com/Postgres-Extensions/pgxntool);
the release machinery (`make tag`, `make dist`) lives in `pgxntool/base.mk`. These
steps cut a new release.

## 1. Pre-release checks
- [ ] Open issues/PRs for this release reviewed, merged or deferred.
- [ ] CI green on all supported PostgreSQL versions (the `all-checks-passed` job on master).
- [ ] Locally: `make verify-results` passes. It depends on `test` (so it runs the suite
      first, then gates on the results). `make test` alone is non-gating — pgxntool marks
      `installcheck` `.IGNORE`, so it never returns non-zero on a regression; only
      `verify-results` (which inspects `test/regression.diffs`) is a real gate.

## 2. Decide the version and what to track
- [ ] Pick the new version (semantic versioning).
- [ ] **Minor change? Consider NOT committing the generated versioned install script.**
      If this release makes only fairly minor changes (unlikely to cross a PostgreSQL
      supported-version boundary), decide whether to omit the generated
      `sql/cat_tools--<version>.sql.in` — it has little update-test-coverage value and
      omitting it keeps the repo smaller (it is regenerated from `sql/cat_tools.sql.in`
      at build time). The update script (`sql/cat_tools--<prev>--<version>.sql.in`) is
      ALWAYS committed. See CLAUDE.md "SQL file conventions".

## 3. Update version + changelog

> **⚠️ CRITICAL — you are temporarily leaving the `stable` pseudo-version.** Master's
> `default_version` normally sits at the `stable` pseudo-version so that source edits
> regenerate `cat_tools--stable.sql` and never a frozen released file. Stamping a real
> version here points the generated current-version file at `cat_tools--<version>`. The
> moment this release is merged you **MUST** flip `default_version` back to `stable` on
> master (step 6). If you forget, the next source edit on master will regenerate — and
> corrupt — the just-released version's install file.

- [ ] Bump `default_version` in `cat_tools.control` (bumped by hand).
- [ ] Bump the version in `META.in.json` — the source of truth is
      `provides.cat_tools.version` (also update the top-level `version`); `META.json`,
      `control.mk`, and `meta.mk` (which feeds `PGXNVERSION`) regenerate via `make`.
- [ ] Advance `release_status` in `META.in.json` as appropriate (unstable → testing →
      stable).
- [ ] Add/finish the update script `sql/cat_tools--<prev>--<version>.sql.in`; confirm
      `ALTER EXTENSION cat_tools UPDATE` from the previous version reaches the new version,
      on multiple PG majors.
- [ ] Stamp `HISTORY.asc`: the top `STABLE` section accumulates user-facing changes as
      PRs land; at release, rename that header to the new version number.

## 4. Verify
- [ ] `make verify-results` green (it runs `test` first, then gates on the results).
- [ ] From a clean checkout (or `git archive` of the tag): `make && make install`
      regenerates and installs cleanly and `CREATE EXTENSION cat_tools;` reports the new
      version — confirms a PGXN consumer can build from the tracked sources alone. (This
      mirrors what `make dist` ships, since it archives the tag: committed files only, so
      any omitted generated install script is regenerated on the consumer's side.)

## 5. Tag and distribute
- [ ] Commit the release changes; working tree must be clean — `make tag` aborts with
      "Untracked changes!" on a dirty tree.
- [ ] `make tag` — creates a git tag named exactly the version, UNPREFIXED (e.g. `0.2.3`,
      matching the existing `0.2.2` tag; no `v` prefix), taken from `PGXNVERSION`, and
      pushes it to `origin`. It is idempotent when the tag already points at HEAD, and
      errors if the tag exists on a different commit. To move an existing tag use
      `make forcetag` (= `make rmtag` then `make tag`); `make rmtag` deletes the tag
      locally and on `origin`.
- [ ] `make dist` — depends on `tag` (and builds the HTML docs), then
      `git archive`s the tag into `../cat_tools-<version>.zip` (parent directory).
      Because it archives the tag, only committed files are included. If a `.gitattributes`
      exists it must be committed, or `dist` aborts (git archive only honors
      `export-ignore` for committed files). `make forcedist` = `forcetag` + `dist`.
- [ ] Upload the `../cat_tools-<version>.zip` to PGXN (manual).

## 6. Return master to `stable` (CRITICAL — do not skip)
- [ ] As soon as the release is merged, flip `default_version` back to the `stable`
      pseudo-version on master (`cat_tools.control` + `META.in.json`), open a new top
      `STABLE` section in `HISTORY.asc`, and re-seed a fresh
      `sql/cat_tools--<this-release>--stable.sql.in` update script for the next cycle.
      Leaving master stamped at the real version means the next source edit regenerates
      and corrupts the released version's install file.
- [ ] `rm` any stale generated `sql/cat_tools--<released-version>.sql.in` /
      `cat_tools--<released-version>.sql` left in the tree — once `default_version` is
      `stable`, `make` no longer regenerates them, so they are one-time cleanup.

> The persistent `stable` pseudo-version (a permanent version literally named `stable`,
> with a live `sql/cat_tools--<last-release>--stable.sql.in` update script that every
> source fix targets) decouples fixes from version bumps. The machinery is built into
> `sql.mk`; it lands immediately after the 0.2.3 release, so 0.2.3 itself is the last
> release cut before the scheme exists — steps 3/6 above describe the flow from the
> next release onward.

## Notes and caveats

- **0.2.3 catalog-view repair / `pg_upgrade` caveat.** Databases updated from
  0.2.0/0.2.1 hold broken catalog views that fail binary `pg_upgrade` to PostgreSQL
  12+ until the extension is updated to 0.2.3 (the update rebuilds them, dropping and
  recreating the public `pg_class_v`/`column`/`pg_class()` objects without `CASCADE`).
  Surface this in the release notes when people may cross the PG 11 → 12+ boundary. See
  README.asc "Updating the extension" and
  https://github.com/Postgres-Extensions/cat_tools/pull/42.
